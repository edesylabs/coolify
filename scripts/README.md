## 📦 Migration Scripts (For Moving to New Server)

These are **only needed** if you're migrating to a completely different server (not upgrading in-place).

### **`backup-for-migration.sh`** - Create Migration Backup

Creates a complete backup for migrating to a new server.

**When to use:** You want to move Coolify from Server A to Server B

**Usage on OLD server:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edesylabs/coolify/refs/heads/main/scripts/backup-for-migration.sh -o backup.sh
chmod +x backup.sh
./backup.sh
```

Creates: `/root/coolify-migration-TIMESTAMP.tar.gz`

---

### **`restore-from-migration.sh`** - Restore on New Server

Restores backup on a new server.

**When to use:** After installing custom Coolify on new server, restore old data

**Usage on NEW server:**
```bash
# 1. First install custom Coolify
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edesylabs/coolify/refs/heads/main/scripts/coolify-custom.sh -o coolify.sh
chmod +x coolify.sh
sudo ./coolify.sh  # Select "Install Custom Coolify"

# 2. Transfer backup from old server
scp root@OLD_SERVER:/root/coolify-migration-*.tar.gz /root/

# 3. Restore
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edesylabs/coolify/refs/heads/main/scripts/restore-from-migration.sh -o restore.sh
chmod +x restore.sh
./restore.sh
```
